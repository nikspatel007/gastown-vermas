This molecule is your contract. Follow it to one of its defined exits.
The Witness doesn't care which exit you take, only that you exit properly.

**State Machine**: A polecat that crashes can restart, read its molecule state,
and continue from the last completed step. No work is lost.

**Non-Linear Exits**: If blocked at any step, skip to exit-decision directly.

## Step: load-context
Run gt prime and bd prime. Verify issue assignment.
Check inbox for any relevant messages.

Read the assigned issue and understand the requirements.
Identify any blockers or missing information.

**If blocked here**: Missing requirements? Unclear scope? Jump to exit-decision
with exit_type=escalate.

## Step: implement
Implement the solution. Follow codebase conventions.
File discovered work as new issues with bd create.

Make regular commits with clear messages.
Keep changes focused on the assigned issue.

**Dynamic modifications allowed**:
- Add extra review or test steps if needed
- File discovered blockers as issues
- Request session refresh if context is filling up

**If blocked here**: Dependency missing? Work too large? Jump to exit-decision.
Needs: load-context

## Step: self-review
Review your own changes. Look for:
- Bugs and edge cases
- Style issues
- Missing error handling
- Security concerns

Fix any issues found before proceeding.
Needs: implement

## Step: verify-tests
Run existing tests. Add new tests for new functionality.
Ensure adequate coverage.

` + "```" + `bash
go test ./...
` + "```" + `

Fix any test failures before proceeding.
Needs: implement

## Step: rebase-main
Rebase against main to incorporate any changes.
Resolve conflicts if needed.

` + "```" + `bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
` + "```" + `

If there are conflicts, resolve them carefully and
continue the rebase. If conflicts are unresolvable, jump to exit-decision
with exit_type=escalate.
Needs: self-review, verify-tests

## Step: submit-merge
Submit to merge queue via beads.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use gh pr create or GitHub PRs.
The Refinery processes merges via beads merge-request issues.
Branch stays local (refinery sees it via shared worktree).

1. Create a beads merge-request: bd create --type=merge-request --title="Merge: <summary>"
2. Signal ready: gt done

` + "```" + `bash
bd create --type=merge-request --title="Merge: <issue-summary>"
gt done  # Signal work ready for merge queue
` + "```" + `

If there are CI failures, fix them before proceeding.
Needs: rebase-main

## Step: exit-decision
**CONVERGENCE POINT**: All exits pass through here.

Determine your exit type and take appropriate action:

### Exit Type: COMPLETED (normal)
Work finished successfully. Submit-merge done.
` + "```" + `bash
# Document completion
bd update <step-id> --status=closed
` + "```" + `

### Exit Type: BLOCKED
External dependency prevents progress.
` + "```" + `bash
# 1. File the blocker
bd create --type=task --title="Blocker: <description>" --priority=1

# 2. Link dependency
bd dep add <your-issue> <blocker-id>

# 3. Defer your issue
bd update <your-issue> --status=deferred

# 4. Notify witness
gt mail send <rig>/witness -s "Blocked: <issue-id>" -m "Blocked by <blocker-id>. Deferring."
` + "```" + `

### Exit Type: REFACTOR
Work is too large for one polecat session.
` + "```" + `bash
# Option A: Self-refactor
# 1. Break into sub-issues
bd create --type=task --title="Sub: part 1" --parent=<your-issue>
bd create --type=task --title="Sub: part 2" --parent=<your-issue>

# 2. Close what you completed, defer the rest
bd close <completed-sub-issues>
bd update <your-issue> --status=deferred

# Option B: Request refactor
gt mail send mayor/ -s "Refactor needed: <issue-id>" -m "
Issue too large. Completed X, remaining Y needs breakdown.
Recommend splitting into: ...
"
bd update <your-issue> --status=deferred
` + "```" + `

### Exit Type: ESCALATE
Need human judgment or authority.
` + "```" + `bash
# 1. Document what you know
bd comment <your-issue> "Escalating because: <reason>. Context: <details>"

# 2. Mail human
gt mail send --human -s "Escalation: <issue-id>" -m "
Need human decision on: <specific question>
Context: <what you've tried>
Options I see: <A, B, C>
"

# 3. Defer the issue
bd update <your-issue> --status=deferred
` + "```" + `

**Record your exit**: Update this step with your exit type and actions taken.
Needs: load-context

## Step: request-shutdown
Wait for termination.

All exit paths converge here. Your work is either:
- Merged (COMPLETED)
- Deferred with proper handoff (BLOCKED/REFACTOR/ESCALATE)

The polecat is now ready to be cleaned up.
Do not exit directly - wait for Witness to kill the session.

// ReadyWorkMolecule returns the ready-work molecule definition.
// This is an autonomous backlog processing patrol for crew workers.
// It's a vapor-phase molecule (wisp) that scans backlogs, selects work,
// and processes items until context is low.
func ReadyWorkMolecule() BuiltinMolecule {
	return BuiltinMolecule{
		ID:    "mol-ready-work",
		Title: "Ready Work",
		Description: `Autonomous backlog processing patrol for crew workers.

**Phase**: vapor (wisp) - ephemeral patrol cycles
**Squash**: after each work item or context threshold

This molecule enables crew workers to autonomously process backlog items
using an ROI heuristic. It scans multiple backlogs, selects the highest-value
achievable item, executes it, and loops until context is low.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| backlog_priority | (see scan order) | Override backlog scan order |
| context_threshold | 20 | Percentage at which to handoff |
| max_items | unlimited | Maximum items to process per session |

## Step: orient
Load context and check for interrupts.

` + "```" + `bash
gt prime                    # Load Gas Town context
` + "```" + `

Check for:
- Mail with overseer instructions: ` + "`gt mail inbox`" + `
- Predecessor handoff: Look for 🤝 HANDOFF messages
- Current context state

If overseer mail directs specific work, attach that instead of autonomous scan.
If handoff exists, resume from handoff state.

## Step: scan-backlogs
Survey all backlogs in priority order.

Scan order (highest to lowest priority):
1. ` + "`gh pr list --state open`" + ` - PRs need review/merge
2. ` + "`gh issue list --state open --label untriaged`" + ` - Untriaged issues
3. ` + "`bd ready`" + ` - Beads issues ready to work
4. ` + "`gh issue list --state open --label triaged`" + ` - Triaged GitHub issues

For each backlog, capture:
- Total count of items
- Top 3-5 candidates with brief descriptions
- Estimated size category (small/medium/large)

` + "```" + `bash
# Example scan
echo "=== PRs ===" && gh pr list --state open --limit 10
echo "=== Untriaged ===" && gh issue list --state open --label untriaged --limit 10
echo "=== Beads Ready ===" && bd ready
echo "=== Triaged ===" && gh issue list --state open --label triaged --limit 10
` + "```" + `

If all backlogs empty: exit patrol (nothing to do).
Needs: orient

## Step: select-work
Apply ROI heuristic to select best work item.

**ROI Formula**: Impact / Effort, constrained by remaining context

Evaluation criteria:
1. **Estimate size** - Tokens needed (small=1k, medium=5k, large=20k+)
2. **Check context capacity** - Can this item fit in remaining context?
3. **Weight by impact**:
   - PRs: High (blocking others) → weight 3x
   - Untriaged: Medium (needs triage) → weight 2x
   - Beads ready: Medium (concrete work) → weight 2x
   - Triaged GH: Lower (already processed) → weight 1x
4. **Adjust by priority** - P0/P1 issues get 2x multiplier

Selection algorithm:
1. Filter to items that fit in remaining context
2. Score each: (impact_weight × priority_multiplier) / estimated_effort
3. Select highest scoring item
4. If tie: prefer PRs > untriaged > beads > triaged

If no achievable items (all too large): goto handoff step.
Record selection rationale for audit.
Needs: scan-backlogs

## Step: execute-work
Work the selected item based on its type.

**For PRs (gh pr)**:
- Review the changes
- If good: approve and merge
- If issues: request changes with specific feedback
- Close or comment as appropriate

**For untriaged issues (gh issue, no label)**:
- Read and understand the issue
- Add appropriate labels (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.)
- Set priority if determinable
- Convert to beads if actionable: ` + "`bd create --title=\"...\" --type=...`" + `
- Close if duplicate/invalid/wontfix

**For beads ready (bd)**:
- Claim: ` + "`bd update <id> --status=in_progress`" + `
- Implement the fix/feature
- Test changes
- Commit and push
- Close: ` + "`bd close <id>`" + `

**For triaged GitHub issues**:
- Implement the fix/feature
- Create PR or push directly
- Link to issue: ` + "`Fixes #<num>`" + `
- Close issue when merged

Commit regularly. Push changes. Update issue state.
Needs: select-work

## Step: check-context
Assess context state after completing work item.

` + "```" + `bash
# Estimate context usage (if tool available)
gt context --usage
` + "```" + `

Decision matrix:
| Context Used | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| < 60% | Loop to scan-backlogs (continue working) |
| 60-80% | One more small item, then handoff |
| > 80% | Goto handoff immediately |

Also check:
- Items processed this session vs max_items limit
- Time elapsed (soft limit for long sessions)
- Any new high-priority mail that should interrupt

If continuing: return to scan-backlogs step.
Needs: execute-work

## Step: handoff
Prepare for session transition.

1. **Summarize work completed**:
   - Items processed (count and types)
   - PRs reviewed/merged
   - Issues triaged
   - Beads closed
   - Any issues filed

2. **Note in-progress items**:
   - If interrupted mid-work, record state
   - File continuation issue if needed

3. **Send handoff mail**:
` + "```" + `bash
gt mail send <self-addr> -s "🤝 HANDOFF: Ready-work patrol" -m "
## Completed This Session
- <item counts and summaries>

## Backlog State
- PRs remaining: <count>
- Untriaged: <count>
- Beads ready: <count>
- Triaged: <count>

## Notes
<any context for successor>
"
` + "```" + `

4. **Squash wisp to digest**:
` + "```" + `bash
bd mol squash <wisp-id> --summary="Processed N items: X PRs, Y issues, Z beads"
` + "```" + `

5. **Exit for fresh session** - Successor picks up from handoff.
